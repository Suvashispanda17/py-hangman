🌟 Hangman Game Implementation in Python 🎮✨

I'm excited to share my latest project: a text-based Hangman game developed in Python! This project highlights my programming skills and my ability to create interactive applications.

🔍 Project Overview:
The Hangman game invites users to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. Key features include:

🎲 Random Word Selection: Utilizes the random module to choose words from a predefined list, complete with contextual hints.
📊 Dynamic User Interface: Displays the current state of the word and the hangman drawing based on the number of incorrect guesses.
🔄 Robust Logic: Incorporates game mechanics that handle user input, providing immediate feedback on the game state.
💻 Skills Demonstrated:
Proficiency in Python programming, focusing on data structures, loops, and conditionals.
Understanding of user interaction and console-based input/output.
Application of algorithms for game logic and flow control.
This project has reinforced my programming capabilities and provided practical experience in building engaging software applications. I'm looking forward to enhancing this game and exploring additional features in future iterations! 🚀
